# Subject Detail - Keyboard Shortcuts

Complete keyboard navigation workflow for browsing folders and files within subjects.

## Navigation Shortcuts

### **'1-9'** → Quick Access to Items
- Navigate directly to folders or files by their position in the list
- Numbers correspond to the order items are displayed (folders first, then files)
- Visual indicators show which number corresponds to each item
- Works for both folders (opens folder) and files (opens file viewer)

### **'Escape'** → Go Back
- Navigate back to the previous folder in the hierarchy
- Only available when not in the root folder
- Equivalent to clicking the "Terug" (Back) button

## Visual Indicators

- **Gray number boxes**: Small gray boxes with white numbers appear in the bottom-right corner of the first 9 items
- **Keyboard icon**: Shows when shortcuts are available
- **Help section**: Expandable guide accessible via "Sneltoetsen" button

## Usage Context

- Shortcuts only work on the **"Bestanden"** (Files) tab
- Shortcuts are disabled when typing in input fields
- Back navigation maintains full folder history for breadcrumb navigation

## Complete Workflow Example

1. **Open subject** → View files and folders
2. **Press '1'** → Enter first folder, OR
3. **Press '2'** → Open second item (file/folder), OR
4. **Click breadcrumb** → Jump to any level in path, OR
5. **Press 'Escape'** → Go back one level

## Accessibility

- All keyboard shortcuts have visual equivalents (clickable buttons)
- Gray number indicators match dashboard design for consistency
- Keyboard focus is preserved during navigation
- Screen reader compatible with proper ARIA labels
